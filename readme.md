### NOTE: I uploaded config.env file to github inorder to make testing simpler. I'm aware that uploading config.env in GitHub is forbidden.

## Start Development Server:

> <b>Note:</b> There is a high probability that I won't be able to finish this project with full functionalities in time.
In that case, if the `CODE REVIEWER` want to <ins>check</ins> the output of this project, follow these steps
* Download the project from gitHub.
* Navigate to `main directory` of the project using `terminal`.
* `main directory` means the directory where these files contain `api/`, `movieworld/`, `.gitignore`, `readme.md`
* Then, [Start Node.js Server](#Node-Server)
* And [Start React.js Server](#React-Server)



### React Server
> Assuming you're on the `main directory` of the project. Run this code in terminal
```terminal
cd movieworld
npm run dev
``` 
This will start compiling the react component and host the application on localhost.

<br>

## Node Server
> Assuming you're on the main directory of the project. Run this code in terminal
```terminal
cd api
npm run start
``` 
This will start server on localhost within specific PORT.

<br>

## API Route Define
Here I'm pointing out some API route 

<br>

#### Get all movie Item
```console
Request Type: GET
------------------------
route LINK: http://localhost:8000/allMovies
```
RESPONSE: it fetches all movies list from the databas, if the database is big  this will take a lot of time

<br>

#### Get all movie with limit
```console
Request Type: GET
------------------------
route LINK: http://localhost:8000/allMovies?limit=2

query: limit=2
```
RESPONSE: it fetches all movies list with `LIMIT`. It only fetches 2 movies.

<br>

#### Fetch movies by ID
```console
route LINK: http://localhost:8000/movieDetail?id=6583085cc91fe0f31a601040

query: id=6583085cc91fe0f31a601040
_____________________
id= is the MONGODB's default objectId which is unique.
```
RESPONSE: API route for fetching specific Movie's detail  ID.

<br>

#### Fetch Released Movie
You can choose which field you want to fetch using `projection query`. <br> And you can limit result by using `limit query`.
```console
route LINK: http://localhost:8000/featuredMovie?projection=movieCover-movieThumbnail&limit=2
route LINK: http://localhost:8000/featuredMovie?projection=movieCover-movieThumbnail
route LINK: http://localhost:8000/featuredMovie?limit=2

query detail : limit=2
query detail : projection=movieCover-movieThumbnail
```
Explain: set multiple field using `-` seperator. <br> The route fetches `movieCover & movieThumbnail` Since I wrote `projection=movieCover-movieThumbnail`. <br> 
RESPONSE: API route for fetching specific Movie's detail  ID.
> NB: currently you can't specify more than one separator in the projection.


<br>

#### Create new movie Data
```console
Request Type: GET
------------------------
route LINK: http://localhost:8000/newMovie

```
